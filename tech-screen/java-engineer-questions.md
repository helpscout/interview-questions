# Java Engineer Questions

## Code review 

One part of the interview is a discussion of a very short code review. You will be sent an archive with small batch of Java files. We ask you to spend a few minutes to review these files and familiarize yourself with the code. 
    
You don't have to share anything with us beforehand! Just come prepared to have a conversation about the following during the interview. 
- quality
- improvements
- code smells 


## Core concepts and data structures

### Data Structures 

- Could you explain what is a map data structure and what implementations of Map do you know in Java? What are the differences between them?
- Describe the difference between an array and a map. 
    - Specific language implementation questions Java (Describe a map vs. treemap)
    - When would you use a map over an array?
    -  How would you traverse all the values in a map?
- Why would you use a linkedlist over an array? Insert/delete in the middle run times of linkedlist vs array.

### Object oriented design

- Explain a class and an object and their differences
- Can you describe what design patterns are and list a few?
- Which is your favorite pattern and in what situations would you apply it?
- Can you describe one common anti pattern?
- Explain composition vs inheritance
- Are there any problems with languages that support multiple inheritance?
- What's the difference between a dynamically typed language vs a statically typed language?

### Databases

- What is an index, how do they work and why would we use one?
- Could you describe us pros and cons of document oriented database in relation to relational databases?
- What's are primary and foreign keys?
- Why would we choose to denormalize data?
- What is CAP theorem?
- What is ACID in relation to databases?
- What is an inner join? Left join? Right join? How are they different?

### Programming languages

- What languages have you used?
- General discussion about Java/Kotlin, favorite features and worst things in Java.


## Situational/behavioral Questions
- Give us an example of a time you inherited a legacy code base.
    - What was one of the larger challenges that you faced?
    - How did you solve it?
    - What did you want to improve for the next person?
- What is the most challenging issue of scale that you've had to address in your career?
- Would you strive to have 100% test coverage on a project and if so why? (or why not). General discussion.
- Describe a situation where you had performance problems with a system.
    - How did you diagnose the problem?
    - What was your solution?
- How have you done code reviews in the past, what did you like and what would you want to change?


## Professional development
- Could you tell us how do you usually deal with difficult problems while coding (the situation when you donâ€™t know how the solution)?
- Who are your favorite technical authors?
